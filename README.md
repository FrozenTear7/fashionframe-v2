### What is Fashionframe?

Fashionframe is what Warframe players call _"The true endgame"_, which is modifying your frames, operator and other parts with different skins, colors, that look the best in your own eye.

Many modifications are being given out by the developers during events or alerts, so make sure to watch out for that, you can also buy specific ones from **Baro Ki'Teer** or simply spend platinum in the market.

Fashionframe is a social hub for Warframe players, where they can share their fashion setups and use those, created by others.

These fashion setups include attachments, syandanas, colors and skins for all availables frames in the game.

_(Operators, railjacks, companions and others will be added in the future)_

### Recommended sites for your own fashionframe

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - website that helps generate color schemes, that you can use for your setups

[Polychrome](https://polychrome.seldszar.fr/) - website with all current color schemes in the game, that helps you find the closest color in each pallet

Personally I pick a leading color for the biggest part of the frame, then put that color in Coolors and lock it.
The rest of the colors (3 of the 4) will be generated randomly and make a whole color scheme. I simply reroll it until I find something fitting, then put the RGB colors into Polychrome and find which closest colors I own in the form of pallets. Then I simply use those colors on the rest of the parts pick fitting attachments and v'oila.
